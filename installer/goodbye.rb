Please take a look at the datepicker.js file in public/javascripts for
documentation.

To use the Rails view helpers, add the following line to your application.rb:

require 'date_picker'

Then you can use 
  date_picker( object_name, method )
and 
  date_picker_tag( name, value=Date.today )
in your views.

enjoy!
